# SoloLevel
Solo Leveling Habit Tracker is a gamified productivity app inspired by the Solo Leveling system. It turns daily habits into an RPG-style experience with XP, levels, streaks, ranks, and real-time visual analytics. This repository includes only the project structure and UI/design, while backend logic is deployed separately on PythonAnywhere.
